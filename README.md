# Stack-OverFlow-Survey-EDA

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on developer survey data to uncover insights into demographics, education, career, and technologies used by developers.  
The analysis walks through data loading, cleaning, transformation, and visualization to highlight key patterns and distributions.

The dataset used here is the **Stack Overflow Developer Survey**.

## ðŸ“Š Steps Covered in the Notebook
1. **Importing Libraries**  
   - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

2. **Loading the Dataset**  
   - `survey_results_public.csv` â†’ main dataset (responses).  
   - `survey_results_schema.csv` â†’ schema (column descriptions).

3. **Exploring the Data**  
   - Inspecting columns and schema.  
   - Understanding question texts.  
   - Previewing dataset size and structure.

4. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values.  
   - Removing/transforming inconsistent values (e.g., multiple genders, age outliers).  

5. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Age distribution of respondents.  
   - Country-wise respondent distribution.  
   - Gender distribution.  
   - Education levels and career insights.  

6. **Visualizations**  
   - Histograms for age and other numeric features.  
   - Bar plots for categorical distributions (country, gender, education, etc.).

7. **Key Insights**  
   - Which countries have the most responses.  
   - Typical age ranges of developers.  
   - Common education backgrounds.  
   - Gender split among respondents.
